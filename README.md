## Overview of Project
The client would like to ascertain how certain campaigns fared in relation to their launch date and funding goals. The following analysis will provide a comprehensive report so that the client can have a concise account in order to formulate the optimal target.
### Purpose
The purpose of the following analysis is to uncover trends based on the Kickstarter data provided by the client.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Through an analysis of the Launch Dates, there is a great deal of success during the summer months, peaking at the very beginning of the season in the month of May. In addition, there is no correlation between the success rate and canceled campaigns, in fact there seems to be no trend regarding canceled campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Through the analysis of the Goals, there doesn't appear to be any direct correlations. Further more, there is a noticable contrast between success and failed when the monetary goal range is $45K-$49999.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges or possible challenges that arise in the analysis is the amount of data provided for examination. The devotion to breaking down the category section as well as converting the timestamps, although necessary and imperative, these tasks are essential.
## Results

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
The limitations are the information doesn't provide exactly how many people gave specific donation amounts. I think that information might provide a little more insight regarding mean median and mode, more specific the mode and subsequently any extremes.
### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a pivot table and bar graph to see how much is raised by the year and month and exactly how much each person is giving to the specific play.

**From May through June is more than likely the ideal time to launch a campaign. The most successful campaign categories are in the areas of Music and Theatre, more specifically -plays.**
